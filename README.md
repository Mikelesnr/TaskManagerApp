# Overview

The Task Manager App is a React Native application designed to help users manage their tasks efficiently. This app allows users to create, view, edit, and delete tasks, making it easier to stay organized and productive.

The app communicates with a Node.js backend server, which handles all database operations using Prisma and SQLite. By separating the frontend and backend, the app ensures smooth and efficient task management.
